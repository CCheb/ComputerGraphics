		GLSL is the language used for shaders (GL Shader Language)
		
		Attribute - you specify how to pull the data out of the buffers you supply.
		Buffers - Data loaded onto the GPU (Normally vertex information)
		
		Uniforms - global variables (in GLSL) that you set before you run the shader program
		
		Textures - Textures are arrays of data you can randomly acces in your shader program.  
		
		Varying - are way for a vertex shader to pass data to the fragmentShader.
